This is one of the easier challenges as it's marked *Easy*. We are expected to use some kind of **SQL Injection** vulnerability.

Welcome to the Light database application!

I am working on a database application called Light! Would you like to try it out?
If so, the application is running on `port 1337`. You can connect to it using `nc 10.10.253.14 1337`
You can use the username smokey in order to get started.


Nmap scan is not necessary as the room tells us to connect to port 1337 and also a user to start with

```
nc 10.10.253.14 1337
```

Since this is a database challenge, let's use some basic SQL Injection
```
'
```


![Flag](/images/tryhackme_light/sql1.png){: width="600" height="450" .shadow}

Maybe SELECT?


![Flag](/images/tryhackme_light/sql2.png){: width="600" height="450" .shadow}

Seems like there is some sort of a word blacklist

Blacklist seems to be case sensitive


![Flag](/images/tryhackme_light/sql3.png){: width="600" height="450" .shadow}

Seems like we've got something

![Flag](/images/tryhackme_light/sql4.png){: width="600" height="450" .shadow}

Let's list the users  and their passwords of `usertable`

![Flag](/images/tryhackme_light/sql5.png){: width="600" height="450" .shadow}


Nothing suspicious, let's list the `admintable`

There we go
